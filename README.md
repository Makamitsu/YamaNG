# Yama Engine

Yet another simple 3D C++ OpenGL-based rendering engine. The aim isn't to get a fully-functional & efficient solution but to (try to) figure out how such soft does work.

### Prerequisites

As much as possible, all the required binaries/lib/external are included when pulling the project.
These libs are the following:

## Using

* [ASSIMP](http://www.assimp.org/) - Asset importer
* [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html) - OpenGL Mathematics
* [Glad](http://glad.dav1d.de/) - OpenGL binding
* [Glew](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) - Another OpenGL binding
* [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/) - Utility library for OpenGL
* [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) - Image loading
* [ImGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) - Bloat-free Immediate Mode Graphical User interface
